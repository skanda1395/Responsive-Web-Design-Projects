        <h2>Before he took flight</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Michael played all sorts of games growing up before he focused on
            basketball.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was 5'11" when he tried out for the varsity baskeball team during
            his sophomore year, but he didn't make the team.
          </li>
          <li>
            He proved himself over the summer when he averaged 25 ppg when he
            played for the varsity team.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>In College</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Under Dean Smith's coaching, he was named ACC freshman of the year
            when he averaged 13.4 ppg (points per game) on 53.4% shooting (field
            goal percentage).
          </li>
          <li>
            He made the game-winning jump shot, which he's notable for, in the
            1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by
            future NBA rival

        <h2>In the NBA</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            From the moment he set foot on an NBA court Michael Jordan dominated
            his sport like few athletes ever had. He had skill and style. He
            turned the

            into a dynasty.
          </li>
          <li>
            He had great initial years, averaging 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting,
            but didn't make the playoffs until the 90's.
          </li>
          <li>
            He had problems getting past Pistons for three years until 1990-91
            season when they swept them and entered their first NBA Finals.
          </li>
          <li>
            His first finals was against the

            led Los Angeles Lakers and he won his first NBA championship and
            never looked back.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Bulls dominated the NBA, winning three-peat, until '93 when
            Jordan's father died in an accident and he retired in 1993.
          </li>
          <li>
            He came back with the "I'm back" retort for the 1993-1994 season.
            And, the Bulls would contiue to dominate and make their second
            three-peat.
